#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding data about Top countries by population to answer questions. 
#Data source https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/ad4f6abbaac0a48aa781

#1. Finding name of the countries with min and max population

select name, population 
from countries 
where population = (select max(population) from countries);

select name, population 
from countries 
where population = (select min(population) from countries);


#2. The most frequent median age based on number of countries

select median_age, count(*)  as number_of_countries
from countries
group by median_age
having count(*) >= 10;


#3. Group countries whether they have above average population, below or equal

select name, population, 
case when
population > (select avg(population) from countries) then 'above average'
when
population < (select avg(population) from countries) then 'below average'
else 
'equals to average'
end as category
from countries;

4. Get name of the countries whose median age is >= 40 and fertility rate >= 2.0

select name
from countries
where median_age >=40 and fertility_rate >=2.0;
